# NotiLyric

NotiLyric is a python lyric library. It's very easy for applications to use.

NotiLyric can download lyrics from the internet (QQMusic is the only providor now) and display current line using a bubble notification.

See the screenshot at: http://johnny-huang.appspot.com/use-notify-system-to-display-lyric
